# Bike Sharing Analysis - Converting Casual Riders to Members

## Project Overview

This project involves an in-depth analysis of bike-sharing data in Chicago to understand the behaviours and preferences of two types of riders: casual riders and annual members. The ultimate objective is to gain insights that can help convert casual riders into annual members, thereby increasing the revenue for the bike-sharing company.

Casual riders use the service occasionally, often on an as-needed basis. At the same time, annual members are regular users committed to a yearly subscription.

## Data

The dataset used in this project contains bike ride data from the first quarter of 2020, including ride start and end times, start and end stations, ride duration, type of bike used, and whether the rider is a casual rider or a member.

## Analysis

The analysis focuses on understanding the differences in usage patterns between casual riders and annual members. This includes when and where they ride, the duration of their trips, and their preferred routes. Various data analysis and visualization techniques are used to explore these patterns and draw insights.

## Key Findings

Some of the key findings from the analysis include:

- Casual riders use the service more on weekends, suggesting they might use it for leisure or tourism.
- Annual members use the service consistently throughout the week, possibly for commuting.
- Certain routes and stations are more popular among casual riders, providing potential locations to target with marketing campaigns.

## Implications

The insights from this analysis can be used in several ways:

1. **Marketing Strategies:** Design targeted marketing campaigns highlighting membership benefits for casual riders, potentially increasing conversion rates.

2. **Pricing Plans:** Understand customer preferences and behaviours to optimize pricing plans, encouraging casual riders to purchase annual memberships.

3. **Product Development:** Provide valuable customer insights to the product development team, helping to guide the introduction of features that attract more annual memberships.

## Future Work

This project provides a starting point for understanding customer behaviours in the bike-sharing service. Future work could involve:

- Expanding the analysis to include more recent data or data from other cities.
- Incorporating additional data sources, such as customer demographics or survey data, to better understand customer behaviours.
- Conducting a more detailed analysis of pricing strategies, including the potential impact of different pricing options on customer conversion rates and revenue.
